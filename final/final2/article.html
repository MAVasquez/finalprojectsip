<h2>What are Toxic Relationships?</h2>


<div><p> <center>A toxic relationship is not only based on physical violence it can be verbal and abusive behavior towards the other person in the relationship or friendship.
	Toxic relationships are like plagues that can attack anyone, in most cases toxic relationships are mostly seen in romantic relationships. This is what we call Domestic Violence. According to an article from, National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, "On average, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States. During one year, this equates to more than 10 million women and men". These facts can be very shocking and seem surreal, yet they are true.

   As stated by the, National Domestic Violence Hotline, an average day consists of up to 20,000 phone calls but many women and men tend to not seek help. Being in a toxic relationship can cause a person to feel physically and emotionally drained which deeply impact the individual's life and health. This brings us to the flower theory. When a person is born they are little seed but, when the person begins to grow they go through a stage of development. This can be seen as the stem of the flower as they are slowly growing and this then leads to the person blooming into a great beauty. However when the person experiences a toxic relationship, they begin to deteriorate into a weak and ill flower. Help is offered to those who are in need of help such as hotlines and shelters around their areas.
