  				<p align="left">
Toxic relationships<br>

Can be violence<br>
</p>

<p> <center>A toxic relationship is not only based on physical violence it can be verbal and abusive behavior towards the other person.Toxic relationships are like plagues attacking anyone, in most cases toxic relationships are mostly seen in romance relationships. This  is seen as domestic violence.According the the article 30 Shocking Domestic Violence Statistics That Remind Us Itâ€™s An Epidemic National Statistics, every nine seconds a woman is beaten. On an average day, referring to National Statistics the domestic violence hotlines receive up to 20,000 phone calls reporting these cases, however this leaves apart of women or men who choose not to seek help.Being in  a toxic relationship causes a person to drain, using the theory o a flower a person is a seed the moment they are born. When the person begins to grow they go through the stage of a stem.When a human is reaching a mature state of mind and is well they are beginning to bloom. When the person is in the beautiful flower stage and is encountered with a toxic relationship they lose themselves and become stage of a deteriorating flower. However when a person seeks help in time they can be rescued and restored again.</center></p>
